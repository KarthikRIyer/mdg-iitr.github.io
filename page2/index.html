    <span class="post-tagline">A way to store and retrieve persistent data in android</span>
    <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2015</span>

    <!--<p>All of you must be done with the first part of the challenge, that is, to complete the form which will be used to take the input data from the user. So now the question you might be thinking will be – how to store this data? Well, it seems there is one very efficient way to do this – Database.
##What is a Database?
With the increasing usability and complexity of the current applications, storing useful data has evolved from being an alternative to a necessity for developers. A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. In computing, the most prevalent approach is the <a href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database&amp;ei=3YCuVL6uM4OPuATViIKYAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnTGY8PBHbHDpPw9B4YR6kdukcLg&amp;sig2=vNAeN_Fy_rv0cunxXXJKMQ&amp;bvm=bv.83339334,d.c2E">relational database</a>, a tabular database in which data is defined so that it can be reorganized and accessed.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-sqlite-">What is SQLite ?</h2>

<p>SQLite is an Open Source database. SQLite supports standard relational database features like SQL syntax, transactions and prepared statements. SQLite supports the data types <strong>TEXT</strong> (similar to String in Java), <strong>INTEGER</strong> (similar to long in Java) and <strong>REAL</strong> (similar to double in Java). All other types must be converted into one of these fields before getting saved in the database.</p>

<p>(If you are not familiar with basic SQL syntax, a quick reference can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/">here</a>)</p>

<h2 id="sqlite-in-android">SQLite in Android</h2>

<p>SQLite is embedded into every Android device. Using an SQLite database in Android does not require a setup procedure or administration of the database. Access to an SQLite database involves accessing the file system. This can be slow. Therefore it is recommended to perform database operations asynchronously.
If your application creates a database, this database is by default saved in the directory <em>DATA/data/APP_NAME/databases/FILENAME</em>.
The <strong>android.database</strong> package contains all necessary classes for working with databases. The android.database.sqlite package contains the SQLite specific classes.</p>

<h2 id="the-cursor-classhttpdeveloperandroidcomreferenceandroiddatabasecursorhtml"><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/Cursor.html">The Cursor Class</a></h2>

<p>A query in android returns a Cursor object. A Cursor represents the result of a query and basically points to one row of the query result. This way Android can buffer the query results efficiently; as it does not have to load all data into memory.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To get the number of elements of the resulting query use the <strong>getCount()</strong> method.</li>
  <li>To move between individual data rows, you can use the <strong>moveToFirst()</strong> and <strong>moveToNext()</strong> methods.</li>
  <li>The <strong>isAfterLast()</strong> method allows to check if the end of the query result has been reached.</li>
  <li>A Cursor needs to be closed with the <strong>close()</strong> method call. It is a good practice to close a cursor object once you have retrieved the values for that particular object inside your method.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sqlitedatabase-classhttpdeveloperandroidcomreferenceandroiddatabasesqlitesqlitedatabasehtml"><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html">SQLiteDatabase Class</a></h2>

<p>SQLiteDatabase is the base class for working with a SQLite database in Android and provides methods to open, query, update and close the database. An object of this class is used to call methods like insert(), update()  delete() rawQuery() query() etc.
In addition it provides the execSQL() method, which allows to execute an SQL statement directly.</p>

<h2 id="some-important-methods-of-sqlitedatabase-class-">Some important methods of SQLiteDatabase Class :</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html#execSQL%28java.lang.String%29">execSQL()</a> method:</li>
</ul>

<p>This method takes an SQL query in the form of a String as parameter and executes it on the current database object.
Syntax :</p>

<pre><code>    databaseObject.execSQL(String SQLQuery);
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html#rawQuery%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%5B%5D%29">rawQuery()</a> method:</li>
</ul>

<p>The rawQuery method takes an SQL query in it’s original syntax and a String array specifying the ‘Where’ parameters as input. All parameter places should be designated with ‘?’.This method runs the sql query and returns the selected rows in a Cursor object. The following gives the syntax of a rawQuery() call to fetch rows from a table ‘books’ with given id:</p>

<pre><code>    Cursor cursor = databaseObject.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM books 
WHERE id = ?",new String[] { id });
</code></pre>

<p>The following piece of code allows you to test whether the query returned an empty set  and it moves the cursor to the first result (when the set is not empty). This code should be always added while executing rawQueries</p>

<pre><code>    if(cursor!=null)
    {
        cursor.moveToFirst();
    }
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html#query%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%5B%5D,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%5B%5D,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29">query()</a> method:</li>
</ul>

<p>This method is analogous to the rawQuery() method but requires a particular set of values to be passed as parameters. The following gives an example of a query() call. Query method is preferred as compared to rawQuery method as it protects you from SQL injections, builds the query for you and prevents having too many string concatenations.</p>

<p>An example of selecting a row with given id and title from the table ‘books’ using query method :</p>

<pre><code>    Cursor cursor = databaseObject.query(books, new String[] { KEY_ID, KEY_TITLE,  }, null, null, null, null, null);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-contentvalues-classhttpdeveloperandroidcomreferenceandroidcontentcontentvalueshtml"><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentValues.html">The ContentValues Class</a></h2>

<p>The ContentValues class is used to store a set of values  and is required for passing and receiving data variables of our table columns.</p>

<p>Syntax :</p>

<pre><code>    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put(KEY_1, abc );
    values.put(KEY_2, xyz); 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="implementation-in-android-app">Implementation in Android app</h2>

<p>The first step towards creating and upgrading a database in your android app is to create a subclass of the SQLiteOpenHelper class.  In the constructor of your subclass you call the super() method of SQLiteOpenHelper, specifying the database name and the current database version.
Let us understand the procedure to create an Android database by creating a table books which stores title and author of a book as data along with an id assigned to each.
In this class you need to override the following methods to create and update your database:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>onCreate()</strong> - is called by the framework, if the database is accessed but not yet created. The basic purpose of this method is to create the table with the required data fields using the execSQL method.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>onUpgrade()</strong> - called, if the database version is increased in your application code. This method allows you to update an existing database schema or to drop the existing database and recreate it via the onCreate() method.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s understand how to implement the methods with an example of a database containing a table storing information regarding books, namely title of the book and its author.</p>

<h3 id="adding-a-book">Adding a book</h3>

<p>For adding a book we store the values of title and author in a ContentValues object and insert it using the insert method of SQLiteDatabase class.</p>

<pre><code>    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put("title", String_Title); 
    values.put("author", String_Author); 
    db.insert(TABLE_BOOKS, null,   values);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="fetching-a-book">Fetching a book</h3>

<p>The rawQuery method of the SQLiteDatabase Class is invoked to select a book title with given id.</p>

<pre><code>    Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery("SELECT title, author FROM books 
WHERE ID = ?",new String[] { id });
</code></pre>

<h3 id="updating-a-book">Updating a book</h3>

<p>We again use the rawQuery method with proper syntax to update our column values of a book with a given id.</p>

<pre><code>    db.rawQuery("UPDATE books SET title = ?, author = ?,
WHERE id = ?,new String[] { title,author,id });
</code></pre>

<h3 id="deleting-a-book">Deleting a book</h3>

<p>The delete method of SQLiteDatabase class is invoked to delete a book with the corresponding id.</p>

<pre><code>    db.delete(TABLE_BOOKS, KEY_ID+" = ?",  new String[] { BookId});
</code></pre>

<p>This completes our discussion of databases and it’s implementation in android applications.

    <!--<h2 id="installation-of-android-studio">Installation of Android Studio</h2>
<p>Android Studio is a latest and most widely accepted IDE designed by Google itself and quickly replacing Eclipse which was used earlier. If you want to develop apps in android then it is highly recommended to use Android Studio instead of Eclipse. Details for download and usage of android studio can be found <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html">here</a> as well as in the following video:</p>

<center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zEsDwzjPJ5c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe> </center>

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>

<p>A typical native android application is written using XML for the frontend (the User Interface) and JAVA for the backend.</p>

<h3 id="java">JAVA</h3>

<p>All the programming part in android development is done using JAVA. Although its a great advantage, if you know a thing or two about programming in Java, but even if you know any object oriented programming language, then it will not be much difficult to relate to the concepts used during development.</p>

<p>Those who are familiar with other programming languages like C,C++ etc might need to understand a few concepts of JAVA which are not so commonly used in C and C++. Some of them have been mentioned here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic understanding of OOP concepts - classes,  functions, meaning of public/private/protected, inheritance etc.</li>
  <li>Use of interfaces</li>
  <li>Types of identifiers such as static, abstract, final etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="xml">XML</h3>

<p>This is used to build the app’s user interface. All user interface elements in an Android app are built using View and ViewGroup objects. A View is an object that draws something on the screen that the user can interact with. A ViewGroup is an object that holds other View (and ViewGroup) objects in order to define the layout of the interface.</p>

<p>The Android developer kit provides an elegant and easy-to-use graphic interface to work with these components and avoid XML, and thus as a beginner, you can directly use this for your app. But as you move on, working with XML provides greater control over the design of the elements.</p>

<p>Here is a list of basic UI elements which are used very often while developing android apps :
*  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html">TextView</a> :  Displays text to the user and optionally allows them to edit it.
* <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/text.html">EditText</a> : EditText is a thin veneer over TextView that configures itself to be editable. 
*  <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/button.html">Button</a> : A button consists of text or an icon (or both text and an icon) that communicates what action occurs when the user touches it.
*  <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/spinner.html">Spinner</a> : Select one value from a set. In the default state, a spinner shows its currently selected value.
* <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/listview.html">ListView</a> : ListView is a view group that displays a list of scrollable items. 
* <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView.html">ImageView</a> : Displays an arbitrary image, such as an icon. The ImageView class can load images from various sources</p>

<pre><code>Now the first task as a part of your problem statement is to develop a form wherein you take the details of a new criminal as input. First of all, you will need a layout(Relative or Linear) to place the rest of the elements in it. Then you can use the EditText element to input his name, address, area in which he lives, and other information. TextView can be used to indicate these fields to the user corresponding to these EditTexts. Explore other elements as well and see if you can ask for more information using them.  Finally have a submit and a clear button to store the record and clear the form respectively.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="running-the-app">Running the app</h3>

<p>An android application can run either on your device or in the emulator that comes bundled with the SDK. Since the emulators can be slow, it is always recommended to use an actual device. <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html">This</a> link contains detailed explanation for setting up your device/emulator for testing.</p>

<p><br />
So that’s it from our side in this blog. In case of any problem you can visit the official android website, which has a huge documentation on almost every topic related to developing Android Studio, including Tools, downloadable Material, Designs, APIs ,etc. You can also post your doubts on this blog or in our <a href="http://fb.com/groups/sdsmobiledevelopment">facebook group</a></p>

<p>We will soon be back with the next blog in the android development series. Till then goodbye and happy coding !</p>

    <!--<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>With crime in Gotham continuously on the rise, Batman is worried that his Utility Belt may not be enough anymore. So he needs you to create a “Bat-App” for him that will help him in his endeavours. He needs to maintain a record of all the wrongdoers spreading havoc in his city. This app should have the following screens :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Home Screen</strong>
  This screen has 2 buttons - New record and View Records. Clicking on New record opens up a screen to create a new record and clicking on view existing records opens a list of records stored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Record</strong> 
  When the user clicks on the new record button he will be taken to a new screen which will have a form asking the user for various inputs like criminal’s name , age , gender , crimes and last known/seen location. There will also be a button to save these records in a database..</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>View Records</strong> 
  This screen will consist of a list of all the records stored locally. On clicking any item, the details of that particular criminal must be shown in the Details Screen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Details</strong> 
  Here is where the details of criminals that are stored in the database must be shown.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bonus-points-for">Bonus Points For</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Elegant User Interface</li>
  <li>If images of each criminal are stored and displayed</li>
  <li>Clicking on the last known location shows it on a map. You can take the latitude &amp; longitude of the location from the user at the time of filling a new entry. A better option can be to just open the map, let the user pinpoint the location and save the latitude &amp; longitude of that location.
