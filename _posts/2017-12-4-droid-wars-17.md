After successful recruitment drives since the past four years, we are back with **Droid Wars** for 2017. Droid Wars is a gateway for first yearites to be a part of an amazing learning and fun experience with _SDSMDG_. Being a part of the group you will be in touch with like minded people, who are mobile development enthusiasts as well as pursue other software development practices. This year we are conducting Droid Wars alongside Winter of Code to give you people a greater chance to be a part of MDG.

-----------------------

## What is Droid Wars ?

It is a hackathon specially organized for first yearites by _SDSMDG_ as a part of recruitment drive. We release certain problem statements and students will have to make an application on Android or iOS platforms according to **any one of them**. Sending a good submission in Droid wars will send you directly to the final interview round of the recruitment process.

**Deadline: 10 January 2018**

**Problem Statements:**

1. Anonymous Twitter ([Android](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/DroidWars2017/prob1_android.pdf) / [iOS](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/DroidWars2017/prob1_ios.pdf))
2. Demogorgon ([Android](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/DroidWars2017/prob2_android.pdf) / [iOS](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/DroidWars2017/prob2_ios.pdf))
3. Photo Editor ([Android](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/DroidWars2017/prob3_android.pdf) / [iOS](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/DroidWars2017/prob3_ios.pdf))

## General FAQs

#### Can I make more changes to the app or should I exactly follow instructions given on the blog?

You first have to ensure that you complete the app according to the problem statement. Then you may add whatever feature you like.


#### What is git / GitHub ? How to use it?

Git is a distributed source control system. It helps to maintain your code and changes in different versions of your project. You may use any git repo hosting service like GitHub or BitBucket.


#### I don't have internet at home, can I compete properly?

We would recommend you to get one temporarily, for usual googling. Although there is no problem if you do not have one. Before going home make sure your code compiles properly. And download the videos of these channels from Youtube (google how to do so), you may even find them on DC++.

You may also want to download the udacity course videos, instructions for which can be found [here](https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-get-Udacity-course-videos-for-free).

If you are already at home, then take advantage of Jio, everybody has one nowadays !!


#### I am unable to find good references?

We have mentioned a few references at the end. If you feel that those are not enough then you can always contact us on our [chat](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/chat) and ask for references. We'll try our best to provide you with the best ones.

Always try to google before asking somebody else, it is for your own benefit !!


## Android FAQs

#### I know CPP only, should I learn JAVA too?

Android is not all about JAVA only. Most of the code we use is easily available on the internet. But you should definitely know the basics of Object Oriented Programming. Basics of Java would be enough. Although your less knowledge of JAVA would not create any hindrance for your selection in the group.


#### I did not attend the lectures, from where can I start learning android ? 

To submit your app on time, the best thing would be if you just search for what you need. For example, you want to know about TextView, just search that term and you would get tons of good links (StackOverflow is preferable). You can learn from android courses on [UdaCity](https://www.udacity.com/courses/android), if you have enough time.  
Here is one more course on youtube, [The New Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAbQgLGKd3Y&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl) (Recommended: Watch only a few videos).


#### Should I know XML too or can the user interface help me with all I need to do?

To submit the app, you may use only Interface but after that it would be good if you learn XML too.


## iOS FAQs

#### Do I need a Mac and iPhone for making iOS apps?

Not necessarily. You can use any virtual machine to run OS X and use the built-in simulator which would just suffice for most of the work. Cross-platform iOS apps which you may have developed using Xamarin or React etc. are also a way to go without a Mac and iPhone. However, please note that the road is not as smooth as for a native iOS devloper who owns both Mac and iPhone.  
> **Useful links:** [About Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) | [Installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYMEb0ZCfes)


#### How should I get started with iOS app dev? Shall I learn Swift or ObjC?

Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun. Objective-C, which is the primary programming language for iOS, is old and hard to code.
You can learn from iOS courses on [UdaCity](https://www.udacity.com/courses/ios), if you have enough time. For getting started, read this [post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SDSWebDev/455571147987371).
However you can follow other iOS tutorial sites like Ray Wenderlich and Appcoda etc.


#### Do I need to upload my app to App Store? If yes, what are the steps I need to follow?

For the Droid Wars, you need not. But in general if youâ€™d like to know, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnbOcpwJGa8) or follow this [blog](https://www.raywenderlich.com/127936/submit-an-app-part-1).
