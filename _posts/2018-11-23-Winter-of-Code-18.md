## <b>Introduction</b>
After its first successful run last year, this year we are back with WoC 18. Winter of Code is an initiaitive by SDS/MDG which is focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work on a one month programming project with a mentor during their winter break.

<br>

## <b>How does it work ?</b>

Students are expected to come up with a proposal of what they want to do during the programme. Students can either collaborate with MDG on their existing projects or they can come up with their own ideas and work on them. The submitted proposals will be evaluated and students will be selected based on the proposal and student profile. Selected students will be mentored by MDG on a one month long exhilirating journey of converting *Caffeine to Code* .
<br>

## <b>Details of the program</b>

The programme will begin with the submissions of student proposals. After careful evaluation of all the proposals, few students will be selected for the projects. The selected students will work on their proposals for the entire month of December. They will be guided by mentors from MDG and their work will be evaluated periodically. Given below are the important dates for the programme.

## <b>Types of Proposals</b>

 <b>1. Existing MDG Projects : </b>
   Students wishing to collaborate with MDG on their existing projects can choose from any of the projects given [below](#projects). Before submitting proposals for contributing to one of the existing projects, take a detailed analysis of the project. Go through their Github repos and take a look at their READMEs and Contributing guides. After choosing the project, students have to submit their  proposal stating the strategy and timeline which they will be following during the programme to implement the TODOs as per project requirements mentioned in the READMEs. Students can also suggest any new changes or features(optional) which they wish to include in the project. To get an understanding of how proposals are to be drafted, take a look at this [blog](http://teom.org/blog/kde/how-to-write-a-kick-ass-proposal-for-google-summer-of-code/) or take a look at this original [GSOC proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18RtcDatYzZ1gpztFUM8K2MUaYfIAwvVFIJKCR-xf6BE/edit?usp=sharing) by one of MDG's alumni, you can also checkout this previous year [WOC proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqoZVCLCVPIDWOqsCG-Mb_KW626AvhAf/view?ts=5bf7cb79).

 <b>2. Proposed apps by students : </b>
    Students can submit their own unique ideas on which they would like to work in the program. While submitting their ideas, students should keep in mind that their ideas should be feasible and genuine. They are also expected to avoid casual and easy stuff such as alarms and calculators in their ideas.

## <b> Our Projects </b>

#### <b> EmojiReactionView</b>
An Android library to make Emoji Reactions on ImageViews ( without changing/modifying the image ) in a manner Instagram does in instagram stories. Users can customize the look to a great extent easily and reliably. This library can be easily used in recycler view. For further details visit this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdg-iitr/EmojiReactionView). 

#### <b>Â Graph Kit</b>

This library allows you to plot different kinds of graphs from data points. The currently supported graphs are Line Graph, Bar Graph and Pie Chart. This library also includes an EditGraphView which you can edit by dragging points and also get normalized points from the curve. To know more, visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdg-iitr/Graph-Kit)

#### <b>Animated Text Kit</b>

Animated Text Kit is a Flutter package that contains a collection of some cool and awesome text animations for the developers to incorporate animated texts almost seamlessly and effortlessly in their apps. To know more, visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdg-iitr/Animated-Text-Kit). 

Don't know what Flutter is? <br>
Flutter allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase. For further information on Flutter, visit [flutter.io](https://flutter.io/)

#### <b>Attachable-floating-menu</b>

AttachableFloatingMenu (AFM) is an [Android Library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) written in Kotlin that provides you with a [Floating Action Button (FAB)](https://material.io/design/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html#)which when triggered opens up a Menu. The menu itself comprises of other FABs. The AFM attaches itself to an [Android View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View) and only appears when that View is long pressed. The AFM renders more FABs around itself in a circular fashion. The user then slides the finger near the desired FAB to select that option. It is majorly inspired from Pinterest's menu. To know more, visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdg-iitr/attachable-floating-menu).


#### <b>Calling-Text</b>

Calling-Text is a mobile application which helps you attach a message/gif with your call so that the receiver can know why you were calling. Calling Text will completely transform your mobile phone experience with a smarter set of features that will improve your daily life. To know more, see the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwWi9P0FIpHjX2otZ2lBVGU1cFE/view) or visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdsmdg/calling_text).

##### <b>Past Year WOC Proposals</b>

To get more insight into writing a successful proposal for Winter of Code, you may go through some of the proposals that were selected last year for WOC:

* [Time Managment app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SpBuewyhZk8wta9u4qw-5FyLg_G_EQkW/view?ts=5bf7cb6c) proposal.
* [Let's find it!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dftOpMQ66thYFwXhsDWaarqQ437vT6cKrV81Jl8FQgs/edit?ts=5bf7cb82) app proposal.
* [Plated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ddu_W2qjYGm5yCSvouJaEc6E2g9FP20H/view?ts=5bf7cb5c) app proposal.
* [Calling Text](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqoZVCLCVPIDWOqsCG-Mb_KW626AvhAf/view?ts=5bf7cb79) proposal (a work on one of our existing ideas).

<br>

*So guys, grab your cup of coffee (or tea, redbull etc.) and prepare yourself for a month long journey of writing beautiful software. Users can customize the look to a great extent easily and reliably.*
